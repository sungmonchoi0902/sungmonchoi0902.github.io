##1 Paragraph Overview

“Meet Myself Through Shout” is an interactive artwork about letting out your feelings by using your voice. In today’s world, many people keep their stress inside and hide their true emotions. This project turns that hidden feeling into sound and visuals. When users shout into the microphone, the screen slowly changes from a blurry image to a clear one, showing their real self. It gives people a digital space to express emotions freely and feel relief through sound, mixing art, technology, and emotion.
